                    <h4>Charge Controller</h4>
                    <p>A charge controller is an important system component that regulates the voltage generated from
                        your renewable energy system and properly maintains your batteries. It protects your batteries
                        from being over- or undercharged, and ensures maximum battery life, performance, and efficiency.

                        Basic charge controllers stop charging the battery bank when the high-voltage level setting is
                        exceeded. Once the charge in the battery bank is drawn back down below that setting, the
                        controller will resume charging. </p>

                    <h4>Inverter</h4>
                    <p>
                        An inverter converts the DC voltage to an AC voltage. In most cases, the input DC voltage is
                        usually lower while the output AC is equal to the grid supply voltage of either 120 volts, or
                        240 Volts depending on the country.

                        The inverter may be built as standalone equipment for applications such as solar power, or to
                        work as a backup power supply from batteries which are charged separately.

                        <h4>Solar Panel</h4>
                        <p>
                            Solar energy begins with the sun. Solar panels (also known as "PV panels") are used to
                            convert light from the sun, which is composed of particles of energy called "photons",
                            into
                            electricity that can be used to power electrical loads.

                            Solar panels can be used for a wide variety of applications including remote power
                            systems
                            for cabins, telecommunications equipment, remote sensing, and of course for the
                            production
                            of electricity by residential and commercial solar electric systems.

                            <h4>battery system </h4>
                            <p>
                                A home battery system stores surplus solar power for later use. The solar battery
                                extends the use of a PV-system’s generated energy and will provide free, sustainable
                                power even when the sun is not shining and the panels don’t produce energy.
                                Photovoltaic systems without a storage opportunity produce electricity to be used
                                immediately. This is rarely effective, since solar energy is mainly generated during the
                                day, when the power demand of most households is low. However, electricity demand
                                increases significantly in the evening.

                            <h4>DC Power</h4>
                            <p>
                                Direct Current (DC) Power refers to the unidirectional flow of electrons and is the form
                                of power that is most commonly produced by sources such as solar cells and batteries.
                                In DC (Direct current) circuits, the flow of electrical charge (or in other words,
                                electrons) is unidirectional and unlike AC Current, it does not periodically reverses
                                its direction.
                                Nowadays for electric power distribution alternating current is mostly used, as it has
                                significant advantages over direct current in transmission and transforming. One of the
                                biggest advantages of DC power is its ability to be used in special applications.

                    <h4>AC Power</h4>
                    <p>
                        Alternating current (AC) power is the standard electricity format that comes out of outlets. The
                        name comes from the waveform the current takes. To understand the composition of the AC wave,
                        you need to understand that electrical currents come from a flow of electrons. As the electrons
                        in an AC wave move, they can move in a positive direction, which corresponds to the upward part
                        of the sinusoidal wave created by the current. When the electrons have a negative flow, the wave
                        drops down.
